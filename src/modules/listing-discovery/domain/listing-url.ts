 * whether to tap a link pasted into a WhatsApp group, which is how listings
 * actually circulate here. They carry no lookup power, and they must not:
 * a title can be edited and a zone renamed, and a URL that stopped resolving
 * because someone fixed a typo is a URL that was never worth indexing.
 *
 * The consequence is a duty on the page rather than on this module. Since
 * every path ending in the same id resolves to the same listing, a page that
 * served all of them would publish unbounded duplicate URLs for one advert —
 * the exact thing Phase 11 exists to avoid. The page therefore rebuilds the
 * canonical path with `buildListingPath` and redirects anything that differs.
