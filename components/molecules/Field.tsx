/**
 * One labelled form field, rendered the same way on every screen.
 *
 * **This exists so that adding a field is one line rather than fifteen.** The
 * publish form first wrote this pattern by hand, eight times, inside its own
 * page — and the parts that must not drift between copies are the invisible
 * ones: `aria-invalid`, the `aria-describedby` that reads the message aloud,
 * the 2px error border, and the submitted value coming back. Eight hand
 * copies is eight chances to drop one and fail silently for exactly the
 * people it exists for. A ninth screen would have started from zero.
 *
 * Every measurement here comes from the design system's own artboard markup
 * (`design/reference/sistema/pantallas-compacto-menta.html`), not from
 * reading a screenshot.
 *
 * ## Three rules this component makes structural
 *
 * 1. **Required is the glyph AND the word**, never colour alone. The design
 *    says so outright, and this form is filled one-handed on a phone in
 *    daylight, sometimes in forced-colors mode where the red is simply gone.
 * 2. **The error is announced, not only drawn.** A border says nothing to a
 *    screen reader; `aria-describedby` is what speaks.
 * 3. **The error comes before the help text**, matching the artboard — and
 *    the help text stays. The rule must not be mentioned for the first time
 *    by the message that says you broke it.
